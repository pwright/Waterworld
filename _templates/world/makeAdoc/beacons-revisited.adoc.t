= Retrieving beacons from other worlds

image::multiworld.jpg[width=80%]


You find that if you think hard enough you can retrieve beacons from these worlds

You find that if you think hard enough you can project your beacons to these worlds.


== How many worlds are there?

Typically, there's a nearby dry world that is easy to retrieve and project beacons to, let's call it the moon.
However, you notice other worlds, dimmer, but whoever is on those worlds is projecting beacons to your moon.

== Notebooks

Despite the immense distance to the moon, you can read the notebook that's lying on it.
You can see that whenever you project a beacon to it, the notebook is updated, cool!

== The moon is in flux

The beacons on the moon can change. 
When the notebook on the moon changes, you find it difficult to retrieve the contents down to your world.
If you cannot retrieve the beacons, it makes it difficult to explore new areas of the sea, where there might be treasure.
