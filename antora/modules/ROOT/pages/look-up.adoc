= Look up


From the water, or shore, it's not a good idea to look up.

But from the cliff top, you can see there are other worlds in the sky.

Those worlds don't have water, they look more like moons. 

You notice that the dry worlds have 'highlands' and 'coasts' with beacons that match your own world.
