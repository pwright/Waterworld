== Imagine

Imagine a video game, consisting of three parts:

* In the water - where the real game play is...
* On the shore - not much happens there...
* On the cliff top - you've got a GPS position, but the only way to proceed is to jump back into the water.

NOTE: There are more worlds in this universe, but you don't get to play on those.

== Into the water

In the water, you are not safe, everything can be lost.
However, it's also the place where work happens.

=== Explore

The water environment is volatile, but resources are available:

* create artifacts
* abundant resources

=== Collect and use tools

Whatever you want to do, there are resources available to you.

=== Travel freely and collect fish

You can move freely and collect as many fish as you want.
There are no restrictions.

=== Get to the shore

When you decide that you've played enough, you can either

* bring all the fish you collected
* dump the fish that are freely available in the water

NOTE: Typically, the strategy is to ony keep the fish you value.

== On the shore

You have a mobile phone with GPS, 
but the shadow of the cliff prevents you from receiving a signal.

Most folk choose to go <<On the cliff top>>.

=== Return to the water from the shore

If you return to the water, you can end up confused. 
For example, you can end up with some fish on one part of the shore and the same fish on another part.
Strange things can happen whenever you try this.

== On the cliff top

On the cliff top, you have a GPS signal, and can view your coordinates:

* They look weird: 4271d8308e2c85dd78ee0065d283647265db2a19
* You've got no map
* You can only ever see the previous coordinates clearly

=== Beacons

Whenever you reach the cliff top, you leave the fish and a GPS beacon at that site.


=== Where can you go?

You cannot move, your only choice is to dive back <<Into the water>>.

NOTE: You can return to the beacon at any time, if you have the correct coordinates.

== Recording geography

While the resources in this game are in the water, you need to record coordinates to return to fish you've already collected.

You use a notebooks to record the locations. 

While the notebook has many pages, you decide to record the coordinates on a single page you label 'master'.

== Look up


From the water, or shore, it's not a good idea to look up.

But from the cliff top, you can see there are other worlds in the sky.

Those worlds don't have water, they look more like moons. 

You notice that the dry worlds have 'highlands' and 'coasts' with beacons that match your own world

=== Retrieving beacons from other worlds

You find that if you think hard enough you can retrieve beacons from these worlds

=== Projecting beacons 

image::slide-imgs/multiworld.jpg[]

You find that if you think hard enough you can project your beacons to these worlds

=== How many worlds are there?

Typically, there's a nearby dry world that is easy to retrieve and project beacons to, let's call it the moon.
However, you notice other worlds, dimmer, but whoever is on those worlds is projecting beacons to your moon.

=== Notebooks

Despite the immense distance to the moon, you can read the notebook that's lying on it.
You can see that whenever you project a beacon to it, the notebook is updated, cool!

=== The moon is in flux

The beacons on the moon can change. 
When the notebook on the moon changes, you find it difficult to retrieve the contents down to your world.
If you cannot retrieve the beacons, it makes it difficult to explore new areas of the sea, where there might be treasure.
